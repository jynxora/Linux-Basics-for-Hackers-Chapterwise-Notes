# 🐧 Linux Basics for Hackers – Chapterwise Notes

A structured, chapter-by-chapter breakdown of the book **"Linux Basics for Hackers" by OccupyTheWeb**, formatted in both Markdown and PDF.  
This repo is part of my 700-day challenge to master Cybersecurity, DFIR, and Quantum Computing — one solid brick at a time.

Rather than passive reading, I’m building **reusable, digestible notes** for each chapter and documenting the learning process transparently — flaws, gaps, growth, all included.
